Virutual Memory Simulation
==========================

Virutual Memory Simulation project simulates the organization of virtual memory within a running process using a dynamic doubly-linked list in C.  The program allows for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, provides leak-aware functions to monitor memory usage, and offers terminal-based controls for pushing and pulling values onto or off the stacks


Installation and Usage
======================

To install and build this tool run the following commands in a terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/Dan-2112/Virutual_Memory_Simulation```
> To clone to repository to your machine.
```cd Virutual_Memory_Simulation```
> To change your current directory to the cloned directory.
```gcc -O2 -Wall -Wall stepX.c -o virtual_mem_simulator``` (Switch X in "stepX.c" to file that you wish to run.)
> To run the compiled file.
```./virtual_mem_simulator```
